# Rapid Fire - Tracking System

- Real-world tracking system for managing the bookings and locations of their extingushers.

### User Requirements
I've been communicating with a member of the team to figure out my user stories to better understand their problem, and refine my functional requirements for the solution.

#### After initial meetings, I've noted the following requirements:
- Given a set inital number of fire extingushers, but can add / remove from each type. 
- Set few types of extinguisher (no more than 5), rarely going to need to add a new type, but safe to has an option.
- Calendar to visualise information about a booking (date out, date in, quantity, types).
- Ability to CRUD bookings and extinguishers.
- Extinguisher {ID, Type}.
- Booking {ID, Company ID, Date started, Date ended, Quantity, Type}.

### Tech Stack
After reviewing my inital requirements, I've decided to use the following technologies to reach my solution:
